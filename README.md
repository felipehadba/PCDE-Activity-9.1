# PCDE-Activity-9.1

This repository contains a short Jupyter notebook (`MIT.ipynb`) prepared for PCDE Activity 9.1. The notebook highlights a few quick facts about the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and embeds the historic MIT seal found in `image.png`.

## Files
- `MIT.ipynb` &mdash; Markdown-based notebook describing MIT and including an image cell placeholder for further exploration or data analysis.
- `image.png` &mdash; Original MIT seal displayed from within the notebook.

## Getting Started
1. Launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook in this folder.
2. Open `MIT.ipynb` to read or continue editing the content.
3. Ensure `image.png` remains in the same directory so the embedded image renders correctly.

## Notes
- The current notebook only contains descriptive Markdown but can be extended with code cells for additional analysis.
- If sharing the notebook, include both the `.ipynb` file and the `image.png` asset so the illustration is visible to other viewers.
